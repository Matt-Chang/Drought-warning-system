Project: Drought Level Prediction for 19 Cities in Taiwan

Developed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the drought level for 19 cities in Taiwan, achieving an impressive R2 accuracy of approximately 0.8 and an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.065.

Key Achievements:

1. Advanced Predictive Modeling: Employed an LSTM model to accurately forecast drought levels in 19 cities, providing valuable insights for water resource management.
2. Extensive Data Training: Trained the algorithm using over 12 years of data obtained from the government's open API, ensuring the model's robustness and reliability.
3. Implementation of Citizen-Focused Solution: Successfully integrated the drought prediction system into the government website, making the forecasts easily accessible to citizens across Taiwan.

Goals:

1. Develop Accurate Prediction Model: Utilize LSTM modeling techniques to create a reliable forecasting tool for predicting drought levels.
Utilize Comprehensive Data: Gather and process over 12 years of data from the government's open API, ensuring a thorough and representative dataset for training the algorithm.
2. Enable Citizen Access: Implement the drought prediction system on the government website to provide easy access for citizens to monitor and prepare for potential water scarcity.

Through this project, I successfully implemented a state-of-the-art LSTM model to predict drought levels in 19 cities with an impressive R2 accuracy of approximately 0.8 and an RMSE of 0.065. By training the algorithm on over 12 years of comprehensive data obtained from the government's open API, I ensured the model's reliability and accuracy. The integration of the drought prediction system into the government website enabled citizens to stay informed about potential water scarcity, aiding in their decision-making and resource management efforts.
